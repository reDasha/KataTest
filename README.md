# A simple calculator with support for Roman numerals

>It's the program written in Go that takes input from the user and performs arithmetic operations on it. The program reads input from the standard input stream and expects the input to be in the form of two numbers and an arithmetic operator separated by spaces. The program then performs the arithmetic operation on the two numbers and prints the result to the standard output stream. The program also supports Roman numerals as input and can convert them to integers for arithmetic operations. If the input is invalid, the program will panic and print an error message.
